# Assembly Studies

A series of assembly programs, written by me to learn assembly.<br/>

Compiled code is stored in bin<br/>
most code is designed for use with the NASM assembler<br/>
see "assembly_instructions" for assembly instructions<br/>
many files are designed for use with DOS and rely on the DOS API<br/>

## Screenshots

### Hello, DOS!
![](hellodos.png "Hello, Dos!")<br/>
This was one of my first assembly programs, i originally wrote it in DOS DEBUG.<br/>

### Red Line
![](line.png "red line")<br/>
This was a simple program to try out drawing graphics using the BIOS<br/>

### Diagonal rainbow
![](diagbow.png "weird rainbow")<br/>
This was originally supposed to be a straight rainbow as below, but i forgot to reset the colour value at every line, meaning it was offset every time, the colour selection was also wrong<br/>

### Straightened rainbow
![](rainbow_correct.png "straigtened rainbow")<br/>
This program is the fixed version of the one above, i fixed the mistakes meaning that it's perfectly straight<br/>
<br/>

### Bootable trans flag
![](trans_flag.png "trans flag")<br/>
This is a disk bootsector that draws a trans flag on screen and freezes the system completely<br/>
<br/>

Recommended programs:<br/>
NASM     - assembly<br/>
SmallerC - conversion to .EXE<br/>
Dosbox   - execution<br/>

Most code licensed under the GNU GPL license v3.0<br/>
see: SmallerC-master/licsense.txt for SmallerC licsense (SmallerC by alextru)<br/>

Have a good day!
