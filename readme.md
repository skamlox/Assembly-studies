# Assembly Studies

A series of assembly programs, written by me to learn assembly.<br/>

Compiled code is stored in bin<br/>
most code is designed for use with the NASM assembler<br/>
see "assembly_instructions" for assembly instructions<br/>
many files are designed for use with DOS and rely on the DOS API<br/>

## Screenshots

### Hello, DOS!
![](hellodos.png "Hello, Dos!")<br/>
This was one of my first assembly programs, originally in DEBUG, it now lives as a nasm-formatted .asm file.

### Red Line
![](line.png "red line")<br/>
A simple program to test graphics drawn by the BIOS

### Diagonal rainbow
![](rainbow.png "weird rainbow")<br/>
Originally intended to be a simple rainbow, a minor error means it was offset at every line. i kept this version in a seperate file to the fixed version, as it looks very nice.

### Straightened rainbow
![](rainbow_correct.png "straigtened rainbow")<br/>
This is the fixed version of the previous program, colour selection and offset was fixed to straighten it<br/>
<br/>

Recommended programs:<br/>
NASM     - assembly<br/>
SmallerC - conversion to .EXE<br/>
Dosbox   - execution<br/>

Most code licensed under the GNU GPL license v3.0<br/>

Have a good day!
